    <h1>Blanaid Hogan's Biography</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Blanaid Hogan was born in Achill Sound, British Columbia in 1996. She grew up in Achill Sound
    <br>before moving to Kenmare, Massachusetts after high school. When she moved to Kenmare,
    <br>she started working for Kenmare Hospital School for Children (KHSC) and her life has been
    <br>chaotic ever since. She’s had an interest in web programming since high school and has tried to
    <br>learn from various guides, but only got as far as HTML and CSS. Then when seeing that the
    <br>KHSC’s website hadn’t been updated in years, she decided to take a web programming class
    <br>because she needed an excuse. </p>
