# ellovett.github.io
-Created ellovett.github.io

-Inserted picture, index.html, and index.css

-CSS file was not linking to HTML file (found out later this was due to curly quotation marks in href="index.css")

-So index.css was deleted; page.css was created

-Created resume.html and pagetwo.css

-Created bio.html and pagethree.css

-This took about 8-9 hours
